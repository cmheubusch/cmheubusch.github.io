### Professional & Academic Aspirations

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub blog! I created this site in conjunction with the NCSU class **ST 558: Data Science for Statisticians**, which I am enrolled in as the final component of my coursework for the graduate certificate in Applied Statistics & Data Management. I work full-time in government relations as a grassroots associate, helping connect our association's members with their legislators while educating them about key issues. My dream is to become a policy director, working to develop pragmatic yet compassionate solutions through legislation, while furthering a meaningful cause. Knowledge of data science will help allow me to leverage data to make the best decisions possible and develop mechanisms that allow for equitable distribution of resources to in-need communities. 

### Hobbies & Dreams for the Future

Though free time is precious and COVID-19 has limited society's movement, I have been steadily compiling my "travel wish list". Over the past several years, I've been on a tour of northern India and gone campervanning in Iceland - but my desire to see the world keeps growing, along with my desire to dive more deeply into nature.

Within the next few years, I hope to have the opportunity to experience more of the outdoors, including: 

* The Smokies *- I moved to North Carolina less than a year ago, but it's high time that I explore this beautiful state.*
* The Colorado Trail 
* The John Muir Trail 
* The Hayduke Trail *- Somewhat of a pipe dream, but I can aspire!*
* Arches National Park
* Yellowstone National Park
* Glacier National Park
* Banff National Park
* Patagonia 

In the meantime, my boyfriend and I have begun cultivating a fruit & vegetable garden - hot peppers, melons, three types of tomatoes, and cucumbers (to be used primarily for homemade pickles!) are the stars of the show, along with flowers such as zinnias, poppies, and coneflowers. We also recently began an effort to grow oyster mushrooms, though we'll likely not see the fruits of our labors for at least another 8-12 months. Additionally, I've been trying to prioritize reading over watching television; while I wouldn't sign myself up for a 24-hour, 100+ mile road race, I couldn't put down Dean Karnazes' memoir [Ultramarathon Man](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/87632.Ultramarathon_Man), a fascinating account of his superhuman endurance pursuits. Next on the list? [Doing Justice](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43166269-doing-justice) by Preet Bharara. That being said, I'm always open to 1) gardening advice, and 2) book recommendations!
