### Professional & Academic Aspirations

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub blog! I created this site in conjunction with the class **ST 558: Data Science for Statisticians**, which I am enrolled in as the final component of my coursework for the NCSU graduate certificate in Applied Statistics & Data Management. I work full-time in government relations as a grassroots associate, helping connect our association's members with their legislators while educating them about key issues. My hope is to one day become a policy director, working to develop pragmatic yet compassionate solutions through legislation, while furthering a meaningful cause. Knowledge of data science will help allow me to communicate effectively and leverage data to make the best decisions possible and develop mechanisms that allow for equitable distribution of resources to in-need communities. I'm excited to engage with the material, collaborate with my fellow students, and take what we learn and apply it in my chosen profession! 

### My Hobbies & Dreams for the Future

Though free time is precious and COVID-19 has limited society's movement, I have been steadily compiling my "travel wish list". Over the past several years, I've been on a tour of northern India, gone campervanning in Iceland, resided in London for a month - but my desire to see the world keeps growing, along with my desire to dive more deeply into nature.

In the near future, I hope to explore more of the outdoors, including: 

* The Smokies 
    - I moved to North Carolina nearly a year ago - it's high time that I explore this beautiful state!
* The Colorado Trail 
* The John Muir Trail 
* The Hayduke Trail
* Arches National Park
* Yellowstone National Park
* Glacier National Park
* Banff National Park
* Patagonia

In the meantime, my boyfriend and I have begun cultivating a fruit & vegetable garden - hot peppers, melons, three types of tomatoes, and cucumbers (to be used primarily for homemade pickles!) are the stars of the show, along with flowers such as zinnias, poppies, and coneflowers. We also recently began an effort to grow oyster mushrooms, though we'll likely not see the fruits of our labors for at least another 8-12 months. Additionally, I've been trying to prioritize reading over watching television; while I wouldn't sign myself up for a 24-hour, 100+ mile road race, I couldn't put down Dean Karnazes' memoir [*Ultramarathon Man*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/87632.Ultramarathon_Man), a fascinating account of his superhuman endurance pursuits. Next on the list? [*Doing Justice*](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43166269-doing-justice) by Preet Bharara. 


All that being said, I'm always open to suggestions for great hiking spots, gardening advice, and books!
